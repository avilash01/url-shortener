# url-shortener

A fast and efficient web application for shortening long URLs into concise, shareable links. This URL shortener is built with Node.js following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, ensuring a clean, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

Features
URL Shortening: Convert long, unwieldy URLs into compact, easy-to-share links.
Customizable Short Codes: (Optional, if you've implemented it) Allow users to create custom short codes for their URLs.
Redirection: Seamlessly redirect users from the shortened URL to the original destination.
Analytics: (Optional, if you've implemented it) Track click counts for each shortened URL.
Robust Backend: Built with Node.js and an MVC structure for reliability and easy expansion.

Tech Stack
Backend
Node.js: The JavaScript runtime environment that powers the application's server.
Express.js: A minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

Architecture
MVC (Model-View-Controller):
Models: Define the structure of the data and interact with the database (e.g., URL.js for URL documents).
Controllers: Handle the application logic, process requests, and interact with models (e.g., urlController.js for shortening and redirecting).
Routes: Define the application's URL endpoints and direct requests to the appropriate controller methods (e.g., urlRoutes.js).
